# Cnote

## Brief Introduction

A note manager based on CLI

It's the programming task for the interview of Microsoft Club in Sun-Yat-Sen University in 2016
Due to the time limit of the task, many functionalities havn't been implemented yet

## Build

```bash
$ cd /path/to/cnote/build
$ cmake ..
$ make
```

## Usage

Basically you can follow the help message of cnote although it looks ugly enough

```
cnote help [<command>]
cnote create [options] <note>
cnote open [options] <note> 
cnote list [options]
cnote show [options] <note>
```

## Last

I'm not sure whether I'll update the program later...maybe...
